This is an important problem because a model that is able to determine whether a given text review is postiive or negative can be used by a book review website to more accurately and efficiently determine which books are more well-liked than other books. Manually determining if a review is positive or negative is time consuming and categorization can vary between different people.

This information is used to create a feature matrix where each document is represented by a vector of these weights.

I opt to optimize one hyperparameter at a time instead of performing an exhaustive search (i.e. gridsearch) of the best hyperparameter combination because training numerous separate neural networks takes a lot of time, especially when implementing changes like increasing ngram_range or increasing complexity of hidden layers. I will iterate through possible values for vectorizer parameters min_df and ngram_range first before the model parameters, because the former deal directly with the feature space and will likely be more impactful.
